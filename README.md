# UDR - University Data Repository

## Description

The repository labeled "UDR" is a valuable resource for me, as it contains some questions and practice that I completed during my Bachelor of Technology studies. This repository serves as a general reference for my work, allowing me to easily access it from any location. The work within the folder showcase the skills and knowledge that I gained during my Bachelor of Technology program, and demonstrate my proficiency in various technical areas.
Additionally, the repository "UDR" not only contains my finished projects and practice, but also includes any relevant drafts and documents. This makes it a comprehensive collection of all the work I did throughout my program. It also serves as a useful tool for keeping track of my work over the time. I can look back at the projects from my early semesters and compare them to my later work.
