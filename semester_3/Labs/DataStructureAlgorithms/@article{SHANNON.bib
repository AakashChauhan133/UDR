   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) allows the communication among various technology and devices that employing the internet with both the capacity to assemble and trade the information. Various devices have been frequently used small-scale controllers like Arduino. Communication between a set of devices connected over a network to communicate under the domain of the “Internet of Things” can deploy various communication models for information exchange. Internet of thing uses several protocol (e.g. HTTP, CoAP, MQTT etc.) in application layers for the transmission of data. MQTT is a protocol that uses the Publisher subscriber concept for communication. MQTT is used to perform several number of tasks to explore its functionality further. In IoT, Energy management in the buildings is an open challenge to the researcher. As a result, the IoT-based Automation system is constructed in this work using the MQTT protocol, in which the energy management is the basic key feature. Further an investigations have been carried out with communication between devices in IoT environment. A setup is established with the connection of devices with complex functionally such as RaspberryPi and NodeMCU (Wi-Fi) to analyze the performance of MQTT when several devices with high request/response ratio are connected to it. This paper is based on the communication between the RaspberryPi and NodeMCU using the MQTT protocol. Here, RaspberryPi act as a server and NodeMCU acts as the client. These devices control each other's devices with the help of MQTT protocol. This proposed system allows the users to remotely monitor their device form anywhere. It will help to save, monitor and control the light and energy in any type of buildings.},

   abstract = {Perpetual energy source is the major research issue in the research community for energy-constrained wireless sensor network (WSN) and IoT applications. Radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting has become a technology available round the clock due to increased communication activities. However, efficient RF energy harvesting for low-power regions [ PRF≤(0dBm) ] is still a challenge. This article proposes a novel RF energy harvesting technique along with an intelligent dynamic energy flow control algorithm. The algorithm works with dedicated energy flow control hardware. It is also able to provide perpetual life time to the ultralow power sensor nodes. A close approximation of the size of the RF energy harvester array is proposed for the perpetual lifetime of the WSN node deployed with wake-up radio for event-based monitoring applications. The model is verified by mathematical analysis, simulation, and fabricated prototype results for the operability in the given system. It is found that the circuit provides improved dc output voltage over the previous benchmark at low power in the range of −20 to 0 dBm. The system can charge a 2.7 V, 350 F supercapacitor with the rate 0.16 μV /s at 0 dBm, 0.125 μV /s at −6 dBm, and 0.08 μV /s at −20 dBm. To prove the utility of the proposed idea, an RF field survey is also conducted and found that the proposed circuit can harvest energy from high power region (≥ −6 dBm) for LTE850 and LTE 900 bands.},

It realizes the basic functions of IoT through the transmission of information, data, and energy between the nodes. To study the reliability of Internet of Things Network Topology (IoTNT) structure, we must abstract IoT as network topology and study the reliability of the network itself from the topology structure. This paper attempts to apply the Space Fault Network (SFN) to the study the reliability of IoTNT. To achieve this goal, the nodes and edges of IoTNT are equivalent to events and connections of SFN respectively. A structure analysis method based on SFN is proposed and used to study the reliability of IoTNT. At the same time, the influence of possible logical relationship between nodes on the reliability of IoTNT is studied. According to the SFN structure representation methods (SFNSRMs), considering different network structures and induced modes, the analysis methods and calculation methods of the evolution process of target event are given. An example is given to illustrate the analysis and calculation process. The research provides the new methods for the reliability study of IoT and the development of SFN.},

   abstract = {Network infrastructure and connectivity in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, opening up many challenges including reliability. Many real-world networks exhibit community structure, where the networked devices can be easily grouped into sets with dense internal connections but sparse connections between different sets. Examples of such community-structured networks can be found in diverse IoT applications such as smart grids, smart cities, and military systems. Due to these critical applications, reliability analysis is of great significance for robust and safe design and operation of IoT networks. In this paper, we present an efficient binary decision diagram (BDD)-based approach to analyze the reliability of an IoT network with community structure and subject to random link failures. As efficiency of the BDD-based approach heavily depends on the ordering of input variables, we make novel contributions by proposing efficient ordering heuristics for individual communities and the whole IoT network composed of multiple communities. Performance of the proposed ordering heuristics for IoT networks with either linear interconnection pattern or random interconnection pattern is investigated. As demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, the proposed ordering heuristics provide significantly better performance in model complexity than the traditional ordering heuristics.},

Reliability networks are a typical example of looped models. Classical fault tree assessment methods fail to assess this kind of model.

This method allows us to handle functions that have sets of prime implicants and of essential prime implicants several orders of magnitude larger than those of the functions that could be handled by existing methods. The key idea that makes these computations possible is to manipulate sets of prime and of essential prime implicants denoted by their meta-products, which are characteristic functions.

@article{Grumberg03,
   abstract = {The size and complexity of software and hardware systems have significantly increased in the past years. As a result, it is harder to guarantee their correct behavior. One of the most successful methods for automated verification of finite-state systems is model checking. Most of the current model-checking systems use binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the representation of the tested model and in the verification process of its properties. Generally, BDDs allow a canonical compact representation of a boolean function (given an order of its variables). The more compact the BDD is, the better performance one gets from the verifier. However, finding an optimal order for a BDD is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, several heuristic methods based on expert knowledge have been developed for variable ordering. We propose an alternative approach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains "ordering experience" from training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders. Our methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers from training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more likely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training sequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then tagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged permutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as examples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order is requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and constructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our algorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used verification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology, using real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random ordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge. We believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will prove even more valuable. This is because it features the ability to learn sub-domain knowledge, something that no other ordering algorithm does.},
